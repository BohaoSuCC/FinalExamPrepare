	abstract = {This paper reflects on a number of trends towards a more open and reproducible approach to geographic and spatial data science over recent years. In particular, it considers trends towards Big Data, and the impacts this is having on spatial data analysis and modelling. It identifies a turn in academia towards coding as a core analytic tool, and away from proprietary software tools offering ‘black boxes’ where the internal workings of the analysis are not revealed. It is argued that this closed form software is problematic and considers a number of ways in which issues identified in spatial data analysis (such as the MAUP) could be overlooked when working with closed tools, leading to problems of interpretation and possibly inappropriate actions and policies based on these. In addition, this paper considers the role that reproducible and open spatial science may play in such an approach, taking into account the issues raised. It highlights the dangers of failing to account for the geographical properties of data, now that all data are spatial (they are collected somewhere), the problems of a desire for n = all observations in data science and it identifies the need for a critical approach. This is one in which openness, transparency, sharing and reproducibility provide a mantra for defensible and robust spatial data science.},

	abstract = {User-generated content is a valuable resource for capturing all aspects of our environment and lives, and dedicated Volunteered Geographic Information (VGI) efforts such as OpenStreetMap (OSM) have revolutionized spatial data collection. While OSM data is widely used, considerably little attention has been paid to the quality of its Point-of-interest (POI) component. This work studies the accuracy, coverage, and trend worthiness of POI data. We assess the accuracy and coverage using another VGI source that utilizes editorial control. OSM data is compared to Foursquare data by using a combination of label similarity and positional proximity. Using the example of coffee shop POIs in Manhattan we also assess the trend worthiness of OSM data. A series of spatio-temporal statistical models are tested to compare change in the number of coffee shops to home prices in certain areas. This work overall shows that, although not perfect, OSM POI data and specifically its temporal aspect (changeset) can be used to drive urban science research and to study urban change.},

	abstract = {Haze pollution is an increasingly serious problem in China. Based on the PM2.5 data from 283 prefecture-level cities in China, we combine the stochastic impacts by regression on population, affluence, and technology (STIRPAT) model and environmental Kuznets curve (EKC) hypothesis and use a geographically weighted regression (GWR) method to evaluate the effects of different factors influencing haze pollution in different regions. Nighttime light data from NOAA was used in place of gross domestic product (GDP) in a robustness test. From a global analysis perspective, the EKC is established, and the inflection point is approximately 40000 yuan per capita; however, the GWR estimate is better than the ordinary least squares (OLS) estimate with an improvement in R2 from 0.20 to 0.75. The GWR estimation results show that different environmental protection inputs have different effects in different regions: 1. Technical inputs tend to increase productivity rather than reduce emissions in most areas except Guangdong and Jiangsu. 2. The industrial output values in Guangxi and Yunnan have a greater impact on pollution than those in other regions. 3. In the central and eastern regions with dense populations, comprehensive public transportation can effectively reduce haze pollution. In terms of environmental protection measures, park green areas can reduce pollution, and due to the current status of industrial waste recovery in China, increasing the recovery rate of industrial waste is not conducive to reducing pollution. This article analyzes different causes of haze in different regions and provides suggestions for implementing different environmental policies in different regions.},

	abstract = {This study assesses the effect of light rail transit system (LRT) on residential property values in Greater Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, where traffic congestion has been a major issue since the mid 1990s. A relatively new technique namely Geographically Weighted Regression (GWR) is employed to estimate the increased value of land in the form of residential property values as a result of improved accessibility owing to the construction of the LRT systems. Using the Kelana Jaya LRT Line, located in Greater Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia as a case study, this paper reveals that the improvement of accessibility to employment and other amenities provided by the LRT system added premiums on residential property values but with spatial variation over geographical area indicates that the existence of the LRT systems may have a positive effect on residential property values in some areas but negative in others. The use of the GWR in this study is identified as a better approach to investigate the effect of the LRT system on residential property values since it has the capability to produce meaningful results by revealing spatially varying relationship.},

The linear regression model has been found inappropriate in this type of study. This motivates us to redefine its error structure to incorporate the spatial components inherent in the data into the model. Therefore, four spatial models emanated from the re-definition of the error structure. We fitted the spatial and the non-spatial linear model to the precipitation data and compared their results. All the spatial models outperformed the non-spatial model. The Spatial Autoregressive with additional autoregressive error structure (SARAR) model is the most adequate among the spatial models. Furthermore, we identified the hot and cold spot locations of precipitation and their spatial distribution in the study area.},
